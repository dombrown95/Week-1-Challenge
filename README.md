# Week-1-Challenge
This project aims to refactor existing code for the Horiseon website to increase accessibility and boost the websites SEO ranking (through changes like alt text arrtibutes).

By modifying the HTML of the website to follow a logical structure, the site is increasingly easy to use for users who may be utilising text readers and other navigating tools. Image and icon attributes also assist users who might not be able to view the website visually.

When changing the intial HTML code, I didn't expect the majority of the links between CSS to break and was shocked when the entire format of the website had changed. This has made me realise that checking the website frequently in the browser is necessary to ensure that changes can be easily identified and reverted if necessary.
